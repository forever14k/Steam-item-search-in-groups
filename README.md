# Steam item search in groups
This extension allows to find items you looking for in steam groups members inventories.(On steam group members page)

**Extension allows filtering results like:**
 * **quality**: strange | unusual | tournament | vintage | genuine | etc..
 * **rarity**: rare | common | uncommon | mythical | etc...
 * **hero**: anti-mage | sven | wraith king | doom | etc...
 * **tag_type**: equipment | crate | ward | courier | etc...
 * **item_class**: pyro | demoman | heavy | etc...

For community inventory also can be applied game filter by using "**game: < game >**", for example "**game:dota**".

**How To:** Find appid and contextid for game items you looking for.
 1. Open any inventory in chrome.
 2. Select game inventory that you need. (for example, "Steam" inventory)
 3. Choose items category if you need to. (for example, "Coupons")
 4. Refresh or open now steam friends page in chrome.
 5. **Thats it.** Now extension grab updated ids and show them up in input boxes. You can now load inventories and search items you looking for.

In my opinion, steam trading system lack of such a functionality.
